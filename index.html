Artist Statement

<div id="background" class="TabThree">
<p class="Group, TabTwo" style="color:white">For this project I wanted to create a Headband that can help with social anxiety, specifically lack of eye contact with others. The relations with the technology that is assisting me is more of a commensalist relationship. The headband is assisting the user in adjusting their social interactions, but the headband does not get any benefits. The project itself is influenced by Lauren Mcarthy's Tools for Improved Social Interacting, specifically the "Happyness Hat". The headband is meant to alert the person when they are starring down at the grown when talking, simply walking in the halls or down the street. My two inpur sensors were the Muscle Sensors and Tilt sensor, which were the outputs. They would then connect to the outputs, Micro Servo, LED and Speaker.The way the piece was going to look I wanted there to be a small capsule holding all the wires and perf board and the extended wires would connect to the headband with all the outputs and inputs. My personal aspect is that I myself sometimes have trouble looking up and having eye contact with people and due to that most interactions I have become awkward and uninteresting, atleast thats how I see them. It also makes it hard for those to see how much that the world can show and I don't think people should miss that.

<p class="Group, TabTwo" style="color:white">One the biggest successes I was able to experience with this project was being able to combine all the code. This was then able to make the gadgets all work at the same time and some worked just how I wanted them to. There were a lot of coding factors that needed to be merged together in order for the code to work. My biggest failure within this project was the inability to successfully transfer all the hardware to the perfboard. When attatching all hardware, even when done correctly, the perf board would not produce the output that the code was supplying. I do have  few suggestions as to why that is but for now the hardware only works on the perfboard. When I had my final product, I thought about possibly connecting my muscle censor to my speaker. The purpose of this would make it where when the muscle sensor hits a certain point or senses when my head is down, the speaker will start playing a noise to catch my attention.
